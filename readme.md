# Checkpoint 02

Commit after each question.

## Javascript: Part I

1. Link to `script.js` in `index.html`

- View comments in `script.js` for the rest of this section's questions.

## Javascript: Part II

1. In `index.html`, link to a jQuery CDN.

- Link to `stoplight.js` in `index.html`

- Create an event listener(s) so that when you click on a light, it turns to its respective color (i.e., top light turns red).

- If you click a light that is already on, it turns off.

- If you click yellow, it switches to red after two seconds.

- Make it so that only one light can be turned on at a time (e.g., both red and yellow cannot be on at the same time).
